Moose Watching

Spring in Algonquin Park offers unparalleled opportunities for witnessing majestic moose in their natural habitat, as they are drawn to roadside ditches by the salt applied to Highway 60 during winter road maintenance operations. At our resort, we ensure your comfort and preparedness for outdoor adventures with our provision of high-quality, 100% windproof and waterproof pants and jackets, complete with cozy polar fleece interiors. We also recommend bringing sturdy hiking shoes for exploring the park’s rugged terrain. As part of your stay, we provide complimentary passes into Algonquin Park, allowing you to explore its wonders at your leisure.

During your visit, don’t miss the chance to discover Algonquin Park’s rich natural and cultural heritage at its two museums, the Visitor Centre, and Logging Museum. Open daily, these museums offer a wealth of information and captivating exhibits showcasing the park’s remarkable history and diverse ecosystems. From late April to May, witness the fleeting beauty of spring ephemerals, a select group of wildflowers that bloom briefly between the spring snow melt and the emergence of the forest canopy. Experience the magic of these delicate blooms before they retreat into dormancy beneath the lush foliage of the forest canopy, awaiting the next spring to flourish once more. Check our Events Calendar for specific operating dates and hours to plan your visit accordingly.
